# ApexPlanet Cybersecurity Internship – Task 1

## Objective

The main objective of Task 1 is to build a safe and isolated cybersecurity lab environment and strengthen my fundamentals in **Linux, Networking, Cryptography, and Security Tools**. This lab helps in gaining hands-on experience with real-world tools used in penetration testing and network analysis.

---

## 1. Lab Environment Setup

To begin with, I created a virtual lab using virtualization software.

### Tools Used

* **Virtualization Software:** VirtualBox / VMware
* **Attacker Machine:** Kali Linux
* **Target Machines:** Metasploitable2 / DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)
* **Network Configuration:** Host-Only Adapter (private and isolated network)

### Steps Followed

1. Installed VirtualBox / VMware on the system.
2. Installed Kali Linux as the attacker machine.
3. Installed Metasploitable2 or DVWA as the target machine.
4. Configured all virtual machines to use a **Host-Only Adapter**.
5. Verified connectivity between machines using ping commands.

## 2. Linux Fundamentals

I practiced essential Linux commands required for system navigation, administration, and networking.

### File System Navigation

* `pwd` – Displays the current directory
* `ls` – Lists files and directories
* `cd` – Changes the directory

### File and Directory Permissions

* `chmod` – Changes file permissions
* `chown` – Changes file ownership
* `ls -l` – Displays permission details

### Package Management

* `apt update` and `apt upgrade`
* `apt install <package>`
* `dpkg -i <package.deb>`

### Networking Commands

* `ifconfig` / `ip a` – Displays network interfaces
* `ping` – Tests connectivity
* `netstat` – Displays network connections
* `traceroute` – Traces packet path

## 3. Networking Basics

I studied the core networking concepts that are essential for understanding how data flows in a network.

### OSI Model

1. Physical
2. Data Link
3. Network
4. Transport
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

### TCP/IP Model

* Application Layer
* Transport Layer
* Internet Layer
* Network Access Layer

### Key Concepts

* DNS and its working
* HTTP and HTTPS
* IP Addressing (IPv4 and IPv6)
* Subnetting and NAT

---

## 4. Cryptography Basics

I learned the fundamentals of cryptography used to secure data.

### Encryption Types

* **Symmetric Encryption:** AES
* **Asymmetric Encryption:** RSA

### Hashing Algorithms

* MD5
* SHA256

### Digital Security

* Digital Certificates
* SSL/TLS

### Hands-on with OpenSSL

* Encrypting a file using AES
* Decrypting the encrypted file

---

## 5. Tool Familiarization

I explored commonly used cybersecurity tools and their basic functionality.

* **Wireshark:** Packet capturing and traffic analysis
* **Nmap:** Network scanning and host discovery
* **Burp Suite:** Web application proxy testing
* **Netcat:** Network debugging and data transfer

---

## 6. Lab Evidence

The following screenshots were captured as proof of task completion:

* Kali Linux running
* Metasploitable/DVWA setup
* Network configuration
* Wireshark packet capture
